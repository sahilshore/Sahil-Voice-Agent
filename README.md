# 🎤 Sahil AI Voice Agent

###   Project Overview

Sahil AI Voice Agent is a %%production-oriented, voice-first conversational AI system%% designed to demonstrate modern agent-based reasoning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and real-time speech interaction.

I am the creator and maintainer of **Sahil AI Voice Agent**, a production-oriented voice-first conversational AI system designed to simulate real-world human interaction using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent-based reasoning.

The project focuses on solving practical challenges in voice AI systems such as latency, response clarity, and browser-based speech interaction. It integrates speech-to-speech and speech-to-text, intelligent routing logic, and grounded responses using domain-specific retrieval pipelines.

Tech stack includes Python, Streamlit, LLM APIs, vector databases, and real-time speech processing. The system is deployed for live demonstrations and interview scenarios, emphasizing reliability and deterministic behavior.

This project demonstrates applied GenAI engineering beyond basic chatbots, showcasing multimodal interaction and system design thinking.

Access to Claude Max would significantly enhance my ability to improve reasoning pipelines, optimize agent workflows, and experiment with advanced prompt orchestration and tool usage. I also plan to extend this project into a more scalable open-source framework for voice-based AI assistants.

###   Problem-Statement

Most AI chat applications focus heavily on text-based interaction and ignore real-world constraints of voice systems such as latency, browser permissions, and response clarity.

This project addresses:
- How to build a %%voice-first AI assistant%%
- How to %%ground responses using retrieval%%
- How to %%design agent routing logic%%
- How to %%deploy reliably on cloud platforms%%

---

###  Core-Objectives

- Build a %%speech-to-speech AI agent%% with minimal user friction  
- Use %%RAG%% to ground answers in domain knowledge  
- Demonstrate %%agent-based decision making%%  
- Ensure %%deployment stability%% on Streamlit Cloud  
- Maintain %%clear, human-like response style%%

###  Key-Capabilities

####  Voice-Interaction
- Captures microphone input directly from the browser
- Converts spoken input into structured agent queries
- Returns synthesized voice responses in near real-time

###  Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-(RAG)
- Loads domain-specific documents into FAISS
- Performs semantic similarity search at runtime
- Injects retrieved context into the agent prompt

###  Agent-Based-Reasoning
- Uses LangChain + LangGraph agents
- Routes queries based on intent (profile, company, general)
- Optionally invokes web tools when required

###  Fallback-Reliability
- Designed to continue functioning even if voice input fails
- Ensures predictable behavior across browsers

###  Local-Development Setup

###  Step 1: Clone Repository

###  Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate

###  Step 3: Install Dependencies

        pip install -r requirements.txt

###  Step 4: Environment Variables

Create a .env file:
    
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

###  Step 5: Run Application

    mlit run frontend.py

###  Cloud Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

Push repository to GitHub

Open Streamlit Cloud and connect repository

Set Main file to:

    frontend.py


Add secrets in Streamlit Cloud:
    
    OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
    TAVILY_API_KEY = "your_tavily_api_key"


Deploy application

###  Browser Compatibilit

    Google Chrome — Best performance and microphone support
    
    Brave — May block mic due to aggressive privacy rules
    
    Microsoft Edge — Voice input may require manual permission enable
    
    For best experience, Chrome is recommended.

###  Performance Considerations%%

    Vector stores are cached to reduce reload time
    
    Chat memory is intentionally limited to save tokens
    
    Voice processing latency depends on network and browser

###  Limitations
    
    Browser-based voice input is subject to permission policies
    
    Streamlit Cloud may introduce cold-start latency
    
    Designed for demo and evaluation, not large-scale production

###  Intended Use Cases

    AI Engineer / ML Engineer interviews
    
    Technical assessments
    
    Voice-based AI demonstrations
    
    RAG + agent architecture showcases
